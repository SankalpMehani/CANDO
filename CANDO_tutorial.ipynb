The function then iterates over all drugs and protein binding sites to populate the matrix with the best score based on the following input parameters: 1) `interaction_score` - the scoring protocol of choice, which can be 'C', 'dC', 'P', 'CxP', 'dCxP', where C is the Tanimoto score, dC is the percentile of the Tanimoto score for the compound, and P is binding site score from the [COACH algorithm](https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/COACH/), 2) `c_cutoff` and `p_cutoff` - set cutoffs which ignore any Tanimoto or binding site score below each threshold, respectively, and 3) `percentile_cutoff` - similar to `c_cutoff` but with the percentile of the Tanimoto score (overrides `c_cutoff` if not `None`).

    "Sometimes there are no drugs associated with an indication (whether it be in reality or in your input indication mapping); in those cases we can use the `canpredict_denovo()` function to suggest putative candidates. Basically, this function counts/sums the number of protein interaction scores above a set threshold for each compound and ranks them according to frequency and strength. This is particularly useful for pathogen proteomes (like SARS-CoV-2 or bacterial proteomes) or for finding which compounds target a subset of proteins of interest (e.g. kinases). In our case, we have a diverse set of proteins, which would render the results meaningless. Instead, we can input a list of protein IDs in which we are interested. We have precompiled a list of bacterial proteins already present in the sample matrix for convenience. Note: if we had read in an indication-genes mapping file, we could use the `ind_id=` parameter to automatically select all proteins associated with said indication. "

Instead of generating a new matrix with all of these proteins and their corresponding interaction values, which can begin to take up a lot of storage if done multiple times, the `'protein_set='` flag can be specified during the instantiation of the CANDO object. This flag contains the path to the protein subset the user wishes to use, which is simply a list of UniProt protein IDs. The CANDO object will automatically check for each ID if it either simply matches any UniProt IDs within the matrix or if that UniProt ID is associated with any PDB chains within the matrix (based on a mapping from the SIFTs project). If there are matches, the CANDO object will now contain Compound objects with only those protein interaction values in their signatures.

    "Next, `generate_signature()` is called which creates a file with the interaction scores against all proteins in the `prot_scores` input file. It is saved in a format similar to `generate_scores()` (e.g. 1000_signature.tsv). NOTE: the interaction score protocol must match the input matrix protocol, which was 'C' as above. If we used a different protocol, these scores would not be directly comparable. "
