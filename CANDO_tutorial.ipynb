    "The function `generate_matrix()` first creates a dataframe for all tanimoto scores comparing each drug in our dataset (2,162) to every potential binding site ligand from the PDB, `cmpd_scores`. Next, it creates a dataframe of all potential binding sites for each protein in our dataset (example set = 64 proteins) with the corresponding binding site score, `prot_scores`. The function then iterates over all drugs and protein binding sites to populate the matrix with the best score based on the following input parameters: 1) `interaction_score` - the scoring protocol of choice, which can be 'C', 'dC', 'P', 'CxP', 'dCxP', where C is the Tanimoto score, dC is the percentile of the Tanimoto score for the compound, and P is binding site score from the [COACH algorithm](https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/COACH/), 2) `c_cutoff` and `p_cutoff` - set cutoffs which ignore any Tanimoto or binding site score below each threshold, respectively, and 3) `percentile_cutoff` - similar to `c_cutoff` but with the percentile of the Tanimoto score (overrides `c_cutoff` if not `None`). These scores represent how strongly each drug may potentially bind to each protein target. We then output the matrix to a tsv file, `matrix_file`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a matrix using the 'C' protocol, which just chooses the top Tanimoto score to any ligand predicted to bind to a given protein, without any cutoffs. This function is parallelized, so setting the vairable `ncpus` will change the number of processors that are used for this function. NOTE: percentile cutoff protocols ('dC', 'dCxP') take much longer to compute than 'C' and 'P' protocols. "

This can be relatively time consuming depending on the amount of proteins, but with proteins on the order of hundreds it shouldn't take longer than a minute or two. If the computation does take a while (let's say >100,000 proteins), you can add a `save_dists='name_of_dist_file.tsv'` flag to save the computation.

    "1. Average indication accuracy (aia) - this value is the average of every individual indication accuracy\n",
    "2. Average pairwise accuracy (apa) - this value is the weighted average of each individual indication accuracy based on the number of drugs approved to treat it\n",
    "3. Indication coverage (ic) - this is the count of the number of non-zero indication accuracies\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the metric scores for a given matrix/compound-protein scoring protocol, the more confidence we will have in predictions made using it. \n",

    "An accuracy is calculated for each indication that has at least 2 compounds associated. To do this, we hold out each compound and look for any of the other approved compounds within a certain cutoff of the `Compound.similar` list for the held-out compound. The cutoffs are predetermined to be top10, top25, top50, and top100. There are also percent cutoffs that vary based on the number of compounds in the platform. So, for Indication-A with three drugs approved (D1, D2, and D3), we would hold out D1 and look for *either* D2 or D3 in the top10, top25, top50, and top100 compounds to D1. This would be repeated for D2 and D3. So let's say D3 was recaptured at rank 5 for D1, D1 was recaptured at rank 12 for D2, and D1 was recaptured at rank 27 for D3. The top10 average indication accuracy would be (1+0+0) / 3 == 33%, whereas the top25 would be (1+1+0) / 3 == 66%, and the top50 would be 100%. \n",

    "Generating putative drug candidates for a specific disease is one way we may want to use the predictive power of our platform. For this, we use the `canpredict_compounds()` function, which basically uses a consensus method to rank putative compounds based on how many times they show up as similar to drugs approved to treat the disease within some cutoff. The default cutoff is 10 (the most stringent from benchmarking), but this can be varied. In its current implementation, `canpredict_compounds()` ranks compounds based on the consensus count and uses it's average rank as the tie-breaker. \n",

    "Sometimes there are no drugs associated with an indication (whether it be in reality or in your input indication mapping); in those cases we can use the `canpredict_denovo()` function to suggest putative candidates. Basically, this function counts/sums the number of protein interaction scores above a set threshold for each compound and ranks them according to frequency and strength. This is particularly useful for pathogen proteomes (like SARS-CoV-2 or bacterial proteomes) or for finding which compounds target a subset of proteins of interest (e.g. kinases). In our case, we have a diverse set of proteins, which would render the results meaningless. Instead, we can input a list of protein IDs in which we are interested. We have precompiled a list of bacterial proteins already present in the sample matrix for convenience. Note: if we had read in an indication-genes mapping file, we could use the `ind_id=` parameter to automatically select all proteins associated with said indication. "

Random seeds may be set to ensure the same compounds are used in training. \n",

Instead of generating a new matrix with all of these proteins and their corresponding interaction values, which can begin to take up a lot of storage if done multiple times, the `'protein_set='` flag can be specified during the instantiation of the CANDO object. This flag contains the path to the protein subset the user wishes to use, which is simply a list of UniProt protein IDs. The CANDO object will automatically check for each ID if it either simply matches any UniProt IDs within the matrix or if that UniProt ID is associated with any PDB chains within the matrix (based on a mapping from the SIFTs project). If there are matches, the CANDO object will now contain Compound objects with only those protein interaction values in their signatures. Below is how to use this functionality - this time we can search for the bacterial proteins from the previous `canpredict_denovo()` section, but filter the proteins from the start using a list of UniProt IDs.

The default for this is \"rd_ecfp4\". The tsv file will be saved with the name you provide in cmpd_id (e.g. cmpd_id=7561; \"7561.tsv\") and it will be saved in the directory provided as the out_path along with the fingerprint defined (e.g. out_path=\"examples\"; \"examples/rd_ecfp4/7561.tsv\").

It is saved in a format similar to `generate_scores()` (e.g. 1000_signature.tsv). NOTE: the interaction score protocol must match the input matrix protocol, which was 'C' as above.
