    "\n",
    "The example interaction matrix, `matrix_file`, has already been downloaded via `get_tutorial()`. This function may take anywhere from ~1-10 mins on 3 cores, depending on your computer's processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step we will generate a matrix of 2,449 approved compounds by 64 proteins, populated with the corresponding interaction score betwen each drug and protein. The final matrix will have drugs as the columns (indexed according to the compound mapping file), and proteins as the indices (indexed by PDB and chain ID).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `generate_matrix()` first creates a dataframe for all chemical fingerprint similarity scores comparing each compound in the specified version library `v` (or only approved drugs with `approved_only=True`) to every potential binding site ligand from the PDB using RDKit to compute the chemical fingerprints in which `fp` denotes the type/radius of fingerprint (rd_ecfp4, rd_ecfp8, etc). The vector type, `vect`, can be binary (\"1024_bit\" or \"2048_bit\") or integer (\"int\") and denote the presence or absence or count of molecular substructures in the molecule, respectively. If using integer vectors, `dist` should be set to \"dice\", but binary vectors can be set to Tanimoto (\"tani\"). Next, it creates a dataframe of all potential binding sites for each protein in the specified protein library, `protlib`, with their corresponding binding site scores from the specified binding site prediction method, `bs` (\"coach\", \"cof\", \"ssite\", \"tms\"). The function then iterates over all drugs and protein binding sites to populate the matrix with the best score based on the following input parameters: 1) `i_score` - the scoring protocol of choice, which can be 'C', 'dC', 'P', 'CxP', 'dCxP', where C is the fingerprint similarity score (either Tanimoto or Sorenson-Dice coefficient), dC is the percentile of the C score for the compound compared to all ligands in the library, and P is binding site score associated with the ligand predicted by the [COACH algorithm](https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/COACH/), 2) `c_cutoff` and `p_cutoff` - set cutoffs which ignore any C or P scores below each threshold, respectively, and 3) `percentile_cutoff` - similar to `c_cutoff` but with the dC score (overrides `c_cutoff` if not `None`). These scores serve as a proxy for binding strength/probability of the drug and protein target. We then output the matrix to a tsv file, `out_file`, which in this case is \"tutorial_matrix-all.tsv\" (`out_path` can be set to write the file to a specific directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a matrix using the 'CxP' protocol, which just chooses the top Dice score to any ligand predicted to bind to a given protein, without any cutoffs. This function is parallelized, so setting the variable `ncpus` will change the number of processors that are used for this function. NOTE: percentile cutoff protocols ('dC', 'dCxP') take much longer to compute than 'C' and 'P' protocols. "

This can be relatively time consuming depending on the amount of proteins, but with proteins on the order of hundreds it shouldn't take longer than a minute or two. If the computation does take a while (let's say >100,000 proteins), you can add a `save_dists='name_of_dist_file.tsv'` flag to save the computation. Then, simply use the `read_dists='name_of_dist_file.tsv'` to read in the already computed distances to save time. \n",

    "An important part of CANDO is benchmarking how well we can recapture drugs known to treat the same diseases within their respective `Compound.similar` lists. Currently, our benchmarking code calculates three metrics:\n",
    "1. Average indication accuracy (aia) - this value is the average of every individual indication accuracy\n",
    "2. Average pairwise accuracy (apa) - this value is the weighted average of each individual indication accuracy based on the number of drugs approved to treat it\n",
    "3. Indication coverage (ic) - this is the count of the number of non-zero indication accuracies\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the metric scores for a given matrix/compound-protein scoring protocol, the more confidence we have in making predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "An accuracy is calculated for each indication that has at least 2 compounds associated. To do this, we hold out each compound and look for any of the other approved compounds within a certain cutoff of the `Compound.similar` list for the held-out compound. The cutoffs are predetermined to be top10, top25, top50, and top100. There are also percent cutoffs that vary based on the number of compounds in the platform. So, for Indication-A with three drugs approved (D1, D2, and D3), we would hold out D1 and look for *either* D2 or D3 in the top10, top25, top50, and top100 compounds to D1. This would be repeated for D2 and D3. So let's say D3 was recaptured at rank 5 for D1, D1 was recaptured at rank 12 for D2, and D1 was recaptured at rank 27 for D3. The top10 average indication accuracy would be (1+0+0) / 3 == 33%, whereas the top25 would be (1+1+0) / 3 == 66%, and the top50 would be 100%. \n",

Basically, this function counts/sums the number of protein interaction scores above a set threshold for each compound and ranks them according to frequency and strength. This is particularly useful for pathogen proteomes (like SARS-CoV-2 or bacterial proteomes) or for finding which compounds target a subset of proteins of interest (e.g. kinases). In our case, we have a diverse set of proteins, which would render the results meaningless. Instead, we can input a list of protein IDs in which we are interested. We have precompiled a list of bacterial proteins already present in the sample matrix for convenience. Note: if we had read in an indication-genes mapping file, we could use the `ind_id=` parameter to automatically select all proteins associated with said indication. "

Instead of generating a new matrix with all of these proteins and their corresponding interaction values, which can begin to take up a lot of storage if done multiple times, the `'protein_set='` flag can be specified during the instantiation of the CANDO object. This flag contains the path to the protein subset the user wishes to use, which is simply a list of UniProt protein IDs. The CANDO object will automatically check for each ID if it either simply matches any UniProt IDs within the matrix or if that UniProt ID is associated with any PDB chains within the matrix (based on a mapping from the SIFTs project). If there are matches, the CANDO object will now contain Compound objects with only those protein interaction values in their signatures.
