# CANDO

Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities

---

## Background

CANDO is a unique computational drug discovery, design, and repurposing platform.


## Install

You may download the source code via the releases or cloning the git repository. However, we suggest using anaconda to install the CANDO package, as this is the easiest and quickest way to start using our platform! 

The CANDO package relies on multiple "conda-forge" dependencies. Therefore, we require that you add "conda-forge" to your anaconda channels: 

`conda config --add channels conda-forge`

Then you can install CANDO using the following command:

`conda install -c ram-compbio cando`


## Test

You can test your install by running our script:
